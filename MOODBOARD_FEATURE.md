## Installation & Setup

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install multer
```

### Frontend Dependencies (for future drag-and-drop)
```bash
cd client
npm install react-beautiful-dnd @types/react-beautiful-dnd
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env` files:
```
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

## Security Considerations

1. **File Upload Security**
   - File type validation (images only)
   - File size limits
   - Secure filename generation
   - Virus scanning (future enhancement)

2. **Access Control**
   - Users can only access moodboards for their weddings
   - Collaborator-based permissions
   - Authentication required for all endpoints

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Images stored privately
   - No public access without explicit sharing
   - Automatic cleanup of orphaned files

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Image Optimization**
   - Automatic image compression
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Lazy loading for large collections

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Indexed queries for wedding and category
   - Efficient image metadata storage
   - Pagination for large moodboards

3. **Caching**
   - Image caching via CDN (future)
   - API response caching
   - Client-side caching of moodboard data

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new moodboard
- [ ] Upload single and multiple images
- [ ] Edit image details
- [ ] Delete images and moodboards
- [ ] Filter by categories
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Verify file cleanup on deletion
- [ ] Test error handling

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for file uploads
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance testing for large image collections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not uploading**
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Ensure uploads directory exists

2. **Images not displaying**
   - Check static file serving configuration
   - Verify image URLs are correct
   - Check file permissions

3. **Permission errors**
   - Verify user authentication
   - Check collaborator status
   - Ensure wedding association

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check uploads directory
ls -la server/uploads/moodboards/

# Check server logs
tail -f server/logs/app.log

# Verify database connections
mongo your_database --eval "db.moodboards.find().pretty()"
```
